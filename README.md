# Car Outline Tracking

Framework to track car outlines in a scene, using a CNN for detection, and using thick-edge polygonal approximation to determine its outline. The polygonal approximation is based off the method described in the paper [A Computer Vision Framework for Detecting Dominant Points on Contour of Image-Object Through Thick-Edge Polygonal Approximation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-2035-3_54).
